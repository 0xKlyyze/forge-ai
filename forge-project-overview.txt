# Project Overview: AI Development Workflow Manager

## Core Concept

A centralized cloud-based project management application designed specifically for AI-powered development workflows. The app eliminates the friction of managing multiple project files across devices by providing an auto-organized, template-based system for storing, editing, and previewing all project-related artifacts in one place.

**Primary Value Proposition:** Instant project setup with enforced structure + seamless cross-device access + unified editing environment for documentation, mockups, and assets.

## Target User

**Profile:** Solo developer (18 years old) building AI-powered applications using AI development agents. Works across multiple devices and manages several projects simultaneously. Needs quick context switching and minimal organizational overhead.

**Current Pain Points:**
- File hunting across devices when resuming paused projects
- Manual folder structure creation for each new project
- Context loss when switching between projects
- No unified preview environment for UI mockups
- Time wasted on file management instead of building

**Success Metrics:** Reduces project setup time to under 30 seconds. Eliminates need for local file searching. Provides instant context when reopening old projects.

## Project Scope

- **Certainty Level:** 3/5 (Moderately committed, exploring viability)
- **Build Scope:** 2/5 (Lean personal tool, not enterprise-grade)
- **Commercial Intent:** 1/5 (Purely personal use)

**Implication:** Focus on MVP functionality. Prioritize speed of development over scalability. Use simple, proven tech stack. Avoid over-engineering.

### Data Models

**Project:**
```
{
  id: string
  name: string
  createdAt: timestamp
  lastEdited: timestamp
  status: 'planning' | 'building' | 'testing' | 'paused' | 'complete'
  tags: string[]
  userId: string
}
```

**File:**
```
{
  id: string
  projectId: string
  name: string
  type: 'doc' | 'mockup' | 'asset' | 'other'
  category: string
  content: string (or storage URL for assets)

  lastEdited: timestamp
}
```

**Task (Phase 2):**
```
{
  id: string
  projectId: string

  description: string
  status: 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'done'
  linkedFiles: string[] (file IDs)
  dueDate: timestamp | null
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  kanbanColumn: string
  eisenhowerQuadrant: 'urgent-important' | 'not-urgent-important' | 'urgent-not-important' | 'not-urgent-not-important'
}
```

## UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Layout Structure
- **Dashboard:** Clean grid/list with prominent search and "New Project" CTA
- **Project View:** Three-column layout when preview active, two-column otherwise
- **Responsive:** Desktop-first (primary use case), mobile-friendly later

### Color Scheme
- Keep it minimal and professional
- Light mode default (dark mode is Phase 3)
- Accent color for CTAs and active states
- Category-specific colors for visual organization

### Navigation Flow
```
Home Dashboard
  ↓
Create New Project → Auto-generate structure
  ↓
Project Workspace
  ├── Docs Category (default view)
  ├── Mockups Category (split view with preview)
  ├── Assets Category (gallery view)
  └── Project Management (Phase 2)
```

### File Browser Behavior
- Collapsible categories
- File count badge per category
- Recently edited indicator (green dot)
- Priority level badge for docs (Phase 2)
- Linked task count indicator (Phase 2)

## Auto-Generated Folder Structure

When creating a new project, automatically generate:

```
Project Name/
├── Docs/
│   ├── Project-Overview.md
│   ├── Implementation-Plan.md
│   ├── Technical-Stack.md
│   ├── App-Structure.md
│   └── UI-Guidelines.md
├── Mockups/
│   └── (empty, ready for JSX/TSX files)
├── Assets/
│   └── (empty, ready for images)
└── Other/
    └── (empty, flexible storage)
```

Each markdown template should include:
- File purpose/description at top
- Section headers to guide content
- Example: Implementation-Plan.md includes "## Phase 1", "## Phase 2", "## Technical Approach"

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Source of Truth Priority (Phase 2)
- This feature prepares the app for future API/MCP integration
- When AI agents query project info, they should respect priority levels
- UI should make priority visible but not overwhelming
- Default priority: 5 (mid-level)
- User can adjust per file as needed

### CodeSandbox Integration
- Use Sandpack component (official React wrapper)
- Configure for React environment
- Handle dependencies gracefully (default to React only for MVP)
- Error boundaries for preview failures

### Auto-Save Strategy
- Debounce editor changes (2-3 second delay)
- Visual indicator when saving (subtle)
- Prevent data loss on network issues (local cache)

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load file contents (don't load all files at once)
- Paginate project list if >50 projects
- Optimize image uploads (compress before storage)
- Code splitting for route-based loading

## Development Priorities

### Week 1-2: Core Infrastructure
1. Project creation and folder structure generation
2. Basic file storage and retrieval (cloud)
3. Markdown editor with auto-save
4. Simple project dashboard

### Week 3-4: Editing & Preview
1. Code editor integration (Monaco)
2. Sandpack preview implementation
3. File browser with categories
4. Image upload and gallery

### Week 5+: Enhancement
1. Tagging system
2. Source of truth priority
3. Project management tools (To-Dos, Kanban, Matrix)
4. File linking to tasks

## Success Criteria

**MVP Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] Can create new project in under 30 seconds
- [ ] All standard doc templates auto-generated
- [ ] Can edit markdown files with live preview
- [ ] Can edit JSX/TSX files with live Sandpack preview
- [ ] Can upload and view images
- [ ] Files auto-save to cloud reliably
- [ ] Can access projects from any device
- [ ] Search and filter projects on dashboard

**Phase 2 Goals:**
- [ ] Can prioritize documentation files
- [ ] Can create and manage tasks across all PM tools
- [ ] Can link files to tasks
- [ ] Can tag and filter projects

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Sandpack Performance:** May be slow for complex components
   - Mitigation: Start with simple React components only
2. **Storage Costs:** Image/file storage could add up
   - Mitigation: Firebase free tier is generous; compression helps
3. **Sync Conflicts:** Rare if only one user, but possible
   - Mitigation: Last-write-wins for MVP (version history later)

## API/MCP Future Considerations

The "Source of Truth Priority" feature enables future AI agent integrations:
- AI agents can query project docs via API
- Priority system ensures correct info retrieval
- Potential endpoints:
  - `GET /project/:id/docs` (returns all docs with priority)
  - `GET /project/:id/context` (returns consolidated project info)
  - `POST /project/:id/task` (create task from external agent)

This positions the app as a knowledge base for AI development workflows.
